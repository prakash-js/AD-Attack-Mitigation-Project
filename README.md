# Active Directory Attack and Mitigation Lab
## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
This project is a hands-on exploration of Active Directory (AD) attacks and their mitigations in a controlled lab environment. I built a dedicated lab to simulate real-world attack scenarios, analyze their impact, and implement defenses.

The project follows a structured four-stage approach for each attack:

Explanation â€“ Understanding the attack and its potential impact.

Initiation â€“ Step-by-step execution of the attack in a lab.

Mitigation â€“ Defensive measures to protect AD environments.

Detection â€“ Monitoring attack behavior using Wazuh SIEM + Sysmon.

This methodology provided me with both red team (offensive) and blue team (defensive) perspectives, strengthening my understanding of AD security.
